== Overview
RHOSAK is Red Hat's offering of Kafka as a managed service on OpenShift. Users use tooling to set up an instance of RHOSAK outside of their standard OpenShift environment and connect their applications to use that.

Most of the work has been done in the related issues below, so this RFE is more about testing and documenting.

== Issue Metadata

=== Issue

* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFLY-15019[WFLY-15019]

=== Related Issues

* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFLY-14932[WFLY-14932 - Upgrade to MicroProfile Reactive Messaging 2.0] - This version introduces the new `@Channel` annotation, which makes it easier for users to get data into/from the Reactive Messaging Streams
* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFLY-14932[WFLY-14932 - Configuration of Reactive Messaging Kafka messages] - The API introduced here allows you to get information about how Kafka handled a message, and to influence how messages are sent to Kafka. Most importantly it enables the use of a key for the messages sent to Kafka, which in turn inside Kafka are stored as records. Being able to query them, and not simply use Kafka as a messaging system is important.
* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFLY-15006[WFLY-15006] - Initial Technical Preview feature request for integration with RHOSAK.
* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFLY-13640[WFLY-13640 - Provide Support for MicroProfile Reactive Messaging 1.0 for Kafka] - This was the original issue bringing Reactive Messaging 1.0 into WildFly. Some testing was done against AMQ Streams on OpenShift.

=== QE Contacts
TBD

=== Testing By
// Put an x in the relevant field to indicate if testing will be done by Engineering or QE. 
// Discuss with QE during the Kickoff state to decide this
* [ ] Engineering

* [x] QE

=== Affected Projects or Components
WildFly

=== Other Interested Projects

=== Relevant Installation Types
// Remove the x next to the relevant field if the feature in question is not relevant
// to that kind of WildFly installation
* [x] Traditional standalone server (unzipped or provisioned by Galleon)

* [ ] Managed domain

* [x] OpenShift s2i

* [x] Bootable jar

== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements
* It should be possible to connect to a RHOSAK Kafka broker from an application.
* RHOSAK uses the  `SASL_SSL` security protocol, which uses Encrypted communication with SASL-based authentication
** The SSL certificate is signed by a CA so no trusttore is needed

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

=== Non-Requirements

TBD as we identify pain points during testing. I am not intimately familiar with Kafka/RHOSAK.

Although, when asking the SmallRye team they say that all Apache Kafka https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#consumerconfigs[Consumer] and https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#producerconfigs[Producer] properties are supported, we may want to limit scope somewhat.

== Test Plan
For WildFly we test what we can as indicated in the linked <<Related Issues>>.

== Community Documentation
This is covered by the linked <<Related Issues>>.

== Release Note Content
////
Draft verbiage for up to a few sentences on the feature for inclusion in the
Release Note blog article for the release that first includes this feature. 
Example article: http://wildfly.org/news/2018/08/30/WildFly14-Final-Released/.
This content will be edited, so there is no need to make it perfect or discuss
what release it appears in.  "See Overview" is acceptable if the overview is
suitable. For simple features best covered as an item in a bullet-point list 
of features containing a few words on each, use "Bullet point: <The few words>"
