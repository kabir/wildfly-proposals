== Overview

This aim of this issue is to provide SNI support for all SSL use cases that use SSLEngine.

This will allow for users to specify match rules for incoming SNI names, and at runtime
the appropriate SSL context will be selected for the name.

=== Hard Requirements

This will involve adding a new `server-sni-ssl-context` resource to the Elytron subsystem. This resource will have
a non-optional attribute named `default-ssl-context` that references an existing server-ssl-context.

In addition this resource has a `host-context-map` attribute, this maps names names (which may be
wildcard names) to `server-ssl-context` resources, and will be used by the SNI support to determine the correct context
to choose. Wildcard names use `*` as a wildcard, and can only be used to match a single level of subdomain in much the
same way as with wildcard certificates.

This `server-sni-ssl-context` will provide the same capabilities as `server-ssl-context` and should be able to be
used anywhere that accepts a `server-ssl-context` (the exception to this is anything that requires a `SSLSocket`, but
I don't think we have any at present).

When a `SSLEngine` is created a wrapper engine will be created, and will attempt to parse any incoming client
hello message to determine the correct underlying `SSLContext` to use. If no SNI information is present then
the default will be used. Non wildcard names are matched before wildcard names.

Once the correct `SSLContext` has been selected it is used to create the correct SSLEngine, which then handles the
connection as normal.

This must also work with ALPN to allow HTTP/2 to work. As such it must be possible to register some kind of callback to
be invoked when the underlying engine is selected, in order to allow Undertow to perform its HTTP/2 integration.


=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

* SSLSocket support, although only if it turns out something needs it. This can be implemeneted using an approach similar
to that taken by Wildfly OpenSSL.

=== Non-Requirements

* Client side SNI support is not supported at this time.
